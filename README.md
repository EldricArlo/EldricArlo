  <p>While I am an ordinary college <strong>student</strong>.</p>
  <p>I am dedicated to mastering the syntax, usage, and style of code in every project I undertake.</p>
  <p>It is my hope that each project I create proves to be useful and beneficial to you,</p>
  <p>and that I can contribute a faint glimmer of light to the world.</p>
  <p>Becoming an excellent architect has always been my aspiration,</p>
  <p><strong>and I hope you also become the person you strive to be.</strong></p>
